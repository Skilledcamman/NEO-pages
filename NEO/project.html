            <p>I developed a web app called NEO.js, which displays near-Earth objects (NEOs) that are potentially hazardous, including meteors and asteroids. The project was primarily built using JavaScript, leveraging the three.js library for 3D visualization and CSS2DRenderer for labeling. Upon clicking the labels, users can access detailed information about each object, including impact chance, average diameter, closest approach distance, close approach date, and 3D models. The app visualizes these objects around Earth, though the sizes are not to scale, as they would be too small to represent meaningfully. Using CSS2DRenderer, I made the objects clickable through the EventListener function, and when a label is clicked, a popup appears, displaying basic data and a 3D model of the object in GIF format, created using Blender and public 3D resources from Sketchfab and NASA. I gathered data on size, closest approach distance, and date of approach from various sources, including Wikipedia, NASAâ€™s Eyes on Asteroids, and The Sky Live; for higher-risk objects, data was readily available, but for less prominent objects like 2012 TY52 and 1998 KJ9, I expanded my search to resources like the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This project simplifies the process of educating people about potent
