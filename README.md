[NEO.js](https://skilledcamman.github.io/NEO-pages/) is an orrery web app devloped in JavaScript mainly using the three.js library, The app depicts multiple objects which were, are or will be considered as Potentially Hazardous Object's (PHO's) at some point, the webapp provides data such as chance of impact, size, closest approach distance, and date of closest approach. This is a simple way to educate people on Near Earth Object's and their hazardous status with the help of visual space that you can move around in, It also depicts 3d models of some of the Objects which match real life. 

I used multiple sources for this project including NASA eyes on asteroids, TheSkyLive, Wikipedia, Space Reference, Universe Guide etc. 

I used utilized VScode for programming the app, Github for uploading my code on a repo which made a good backup and Github Pages which allows hosting of web pages on a server for free.

I utilized ChatGPT for helping with errors and simple tasks that I ran across.

This was a great project to test my programming skills which I mainly lacked, but I was still able to complete this project and make it look decent.
